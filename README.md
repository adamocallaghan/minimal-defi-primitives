# Minimal DeFi Primitives

## WHAT...
This repo will eventually contain a batch of minimal - but *insecure* - smart contract for various DeFi primitives.
These contracts are not secure, gas efficient, or in any way optimised; they are exclusively for learning the *functionality* of the main DeFi primitives, not for production deployment.

List of Primitives:
* Lending & Borrowing
* Staking
* Swap (DEX)
* Stablecoin(s)
* Options
* Perpetuals

## WHY...
There are a lot of resources showing beginner Solidity developers how to write and deploy NFT contracts and ERC20 tokens.
The step up to writing DeFi contracts from there is a big one, as more advanced security concepts are (correctly) required.
My hope is that by focusing on *purely* the functionality of these DeFi primitives it will allow beginners to get a raw feel for how these protocols work, before moving on to securing and optimising them.
